# DateWarehouseADVENTUREWORKS2022
This project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution developed to transform raw data from the AdventureWorks DW database into actionable strategic insights. It covers the entire data lifecycle: from SQL-based ETL and Star Schema modeling to advanced DAX calculations and  UI/UX design.


Key Technical Milestone
Dynamic Date Engine: Implemented a Calculation Group "View date" switcher that allows users to toggle the entire report's context between Order Date, Ship Date, and Due Date using USERELATIONSHIP logic.

Tech Stack
Data Source: SQL Server (AdventureWorks DW).
Data Transformation: SQL Views & Power Query.
Modeling: Power BI Star Schema.
Advanced Analytics: DAX, Calculation Groups.
Design: UI/UX optimized with custom themes and PowerPoint backgrounds.

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Profit Engine
While the business operates across two channels, the Internet Sales channel is the overwhelming driver of the bottom line, contributing $12.06M (92.35%) of the total profit. In contrast, the Reseller channel, despite its operational scale, contributes only $1.00M (7.65%) to the total profit. This suggests that the DTC model is significantly more efficient and should be the primary focus for high-margin growth.

2. High-Value Average Order Value (AOV) Disparity
Counter-intuitively, individual Internet customers spend significantly more per transaction than B2B partners, with an AOV of $501.69 compared to the Reseller AOV of $377.74. This highlights a strong individual demand for premium products and suggests that marketing efforts should continue targeting high-ticket individual buyers.

3. High-Margin Niche vs. High-Volume Engine
The Bikes category is the undisputed revenue engine, generating approximately $95M of the total $110.29M revenue, but it operates on a modest profit margin of 11.58%. Conversely, the Accessories category, while smaller in scale (approx. $1.2M revenue), carries a massive profit margin of 49.84%. Scaling "Accessories" through cross-selling at the point of bike purchase represents the fastest path to increasing overall profitability.

4. Mid-Market Income Dominance
The most lucrative customer segment for Internet sales consists of individuals in the Medium Income ($40k - $80k) bracket. This group out-purchases both the High and Very High income brackets, indicating that the brand's core value proposition resonates most strongly with middle-class consumers rather than strictly luxury buyers.

5. Operational Fulfillment Stability
The business maintains a consistent Shipping Lead Time of 7 days across its operations. Stabilizing this metric at one week is crucial for supporting the high AOV observed in the Internet segment, as individual high-ticket buyers typically have higher expectations for fulfillment speed and reliability.
